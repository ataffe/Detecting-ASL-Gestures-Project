# Detecting-ASL-Gestures-Project
A project to detect hand signs using KNN and Select K Best. The data for the hand signs was pre collected using two MYO armbands. We used the scikit-learn python library to implement both algorithms. The code folder has the python code along with one of the CSV files with the data that we used.
